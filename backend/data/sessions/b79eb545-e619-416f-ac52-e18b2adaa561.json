This is a great framework to follow.\n- A good goal this month is to set up a detailed budget. This will help you track where your money goes.\n- Consider starting a monthly investment (SIP) with 10-15% of your income. Even a small start is impactful.\n- Prioritize building an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of essential expenses. This will give you financial peace of mind.\n- Review all your subscriptions and try cooking at home more often. These small changes can really add up."
