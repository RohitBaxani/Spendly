A higher score can get you better terms.\n- You could comfortably manage a new monthly payment of 15,000 to 20,000 rupees.\n- Try to close small outstanding loans or reduce your credit card debt this month. This can improve your chances.\n- Always pay your existing loan instalments on time. This significantly strengthens your financial profile.\n- Make sure your total monthly payments don't become too high, leaving room for unexpected expenses."
