Improving this will boost your loan chances.\n- Your existing loan payments already take up 42% of your monthly income. Banks generally prefer this ratio to be below 40%.\n- Try to close smaller loans or credit card balances this month. This frees up your monthly budget for new loan payments.\n- Always pay all your dues on time and regularly check your credit report for accuracy. This will help improve your CIBIL score."
