Make saving automatic and \"pay yourself first\"!\n*   **Invest Early with SIPs:** Even small, consistent investments (like ₹500-₹1000/month) can make a huge difference over time. Gradually increase your SIPs as your income grows.\n*   **Track Your Spending & Build a Safety Net:** Know where your money goes by tracking expenses, and aim for an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth) to keep you secure.\n*   **Be Mindful and Goal-Oriented:** Make conscious spending choices, avoid high-interest debt, and set clear financial goals to stay motivated and focused on your future."
