The current figures show no income or savings.\n- Your immediate priority is to build an emergency fund, aiming for 3 to 6 months of essential expenses. This fund is crucial before considering investments.\n- Once a surplus is generated, direct it towards this emergency fund, ideally in a liquid fund for easy access. Liquid funds have historically offered returns of around 5% per year."
